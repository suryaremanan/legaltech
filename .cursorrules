title: "Automated Legal Document Context Extraction & Chatbot Query System with Miistral LLM RAG and Faiss"
description: >
  This rule automates the extraction of context from labelled legal templates, indexes legal documents using an open source vector database (Faiss),
  and fine-tunes the Miistral LLM on the PDF data stored in each client's folder using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application.
  It also integrates a chatbot that leverages the fine-tuned LLM for precise, context-aware query responses, and supports generating an English preview and summary
  when a client's PDF document folder is selected.

# Workflow Rule: Legal Tech Data Processing, RAG Chatbot & PDF Preview Integration with Faiss

## Objective
Automate the manual task of labelling legal documents by:
- Scanning client folders containing labelled templates and PDFs.
- Extracting context using Miistral LLM with a RAG pipeline.
- Indexing documents in an open source vector database (Faiss) for efficient, context-aware retrieval.
- Fine-tuning the Miistral LLM on the PDF data stored in each client's folder.
- Integrating a chatbot for precise, client-specific query responses based on each client's data.
- Generating an English preview and summary when a client's PDF folder is selected.

## Steps

### 1. Data Ingestion & Folder Scanning
- **Description:**  
  Scan a predefined root directory where each client has a dedicated folder containing document templates and PDFs.
- **Actions:**  
  - Identify each client folder within the legal directory.
  - Locate and read templates and PDF files.
  - Extract raw text from labelled sections and from PDFs (using OCR if needed).
- **Expected Output:**  
  Raw text data with labels, ready for processing.

### 2. Preprocessing & Context Extraction
- **Description:**  
  Clean and normalize the extracted text and use the Miistral LLM (via a RAG pipeline) to extract and annotate legal context.
- **Actions:**  
  - Remove noise and standardize formatting.
  - Generate concise summaries (in 3-4 sentences) for each PDF.
- **Expected Output:**  
  Structured context data and summaries for each document.

### 3. Indexing with Faiss
- **Description:**  
  Transform the extracted document text into vector embeddings and index them using FAISS.
- **Actions:**  
  - Compute 384-dimensional embeddings for each document using SentenceTransformer.
  - Normalize embeddings to unit length (to approximate cosine similarity using inner product).
  - Insert embeddings along with document metadata (filename, summary, etc.) into an inâ€‘memory FAISS index dedicated to each client folder.
- **Expected Output:**  
  A FAISS index per client folder enabling fast, context-based retrieval.

### 4. Fine-tuning & Chatbot Integration
- **Description:**  
  Fine-tune the Miistral LLM on client-specific PDF data and integrate a chatbot for precise query responses.
- **Actions:**  
  - Fine-tune the base Miistral LLM with the extracted, annotated legal data from each client's PDFs.
  - Develop a chatbot interface that:
    - Embeds user queries.
    - Searches the corresponding FAISS index for the most relevant documents.
    - Combines the retrieved context with the original query.
    - Uses the fine-tuned LLM to generate a precise response.
- **Expected Output:**  
  A chatbot that delivers context-aware legal responses based on client-specific data.

### 5. Error Handling & Continuous Improvement
- **Description:**  
  Implement robust logging and feedback mechanisms to handle errors and continuously improve the system.
- **Actions:**  
  - Log processing steps, errors, and performance metrics.
  - Establish a feedback loop for clients to report inaccuracies.
  - Schedule periodic re-training of the LLM based on updated data and feedback.
- **Expected Output:**  
  A resilient, self-improving system that minimizes manual intervention.

## Configuration Parameters
- **LEGAL_DIR:** Path to the root directory containing client folders.
- **FAISS_INDEX_CONFIG:** Parameters for the FAISS index (e.g., dimension = 384, similarity metric = cosine via inner product).
- **LLM_MODEL:** Identifier or path for the base Miistral LLM.
- **FINETUNE_CONFIG:** Training parameters (learning rate, epochs, etc.) for fine-tuning the LLM on client-specific data.
- **CHATBOT_FRAMEWORK:** Integration details for the chatbot interface (API endpoints, libraries, etc.).
- **PREVIEW_SUMMARY_ENABLED:** Boolean flag to enable PDF preview and summary generation.

## Execution & Triggers
- **Automatic Trigger:**  
  - When a new client folder or document is added.
  - On a scheduled run (e.g., nightly batch processing).
- **Manual Trigger:**  
  - Via a dedicated command or button in the IDE.
- **Logging & Monitoring:**  
  - Log every processing step with timestamps.
  - Monitor performance and error logs for continuous improvements.

## Testing & Validation
- **Unit Tests:**  
  - Validate folder scanning, text extraction, and vector embedding.
  - Test context extraction and summary generation.
- **Integration Tests:**  
  - Confirm end-to-end processing from file ingestion to chatbot response.
  - Simulate client queries to verify accurate, context-specific answers.
