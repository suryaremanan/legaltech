# Workflow Rule: Legal Tech Data Processing & Chatbot Integration

## Objective
Automate the manual task of labelling legal documents by:
- Scanning client folders containing labelled templates.
- Extracting context using LLaMa2.
- Transforming the data into a structured database.
- Integrating a chatbot for precise, context-aware query responses.

## Steps

### 1. Data Ingestion & Folder Scanning
- **Description:**  
  Scan a predefined directory structure where each client has a dedicated folder containing document templates.
- **Actions:**  
  - Identify each client folder.
  - Locate templates based on file patterns or metadata.
  - Read and extract raw content from labelled sections.
- **Expected Output:**  
  Raw text data with associated labels ready for processing.

### 2. Preprocessing & Context Extraction
- **Description:**  
  Clean and normalize the extracted text and use an open source LLM to interpret the legal context.
- **Actions:**  
  - Remove noise, standardize formatting, and validate labels.
  - Use LLaMa2 to identify and extract context, mapping unstructured text to structured fields.
- **Expected Output:**  
  Structured data segments with context annotations for each labelled field.

### 3. Database Preparation & Structuring
- **Description:**  
  Transform the structured data into a database schema that supports efficient querying.
- **Actions:**  
  - Define the database schema (SQL/NoSQL) based on the extracted fields.
  - Insert processed data into the database.
  - Create semantic indexes (e.g., using vector embeddings) for context-based retrieval.
- **Expected Output:**  
  A fully populated and queryable database containing client-specific legal data.

### 4. Chatbot Integration
- **Description:**  
  Build a chatbot interface that leverages the LLM and the prepared database to deliver precise answers.
- **Actions:**  
  - Develop a chatbot frontend for client interaction.
  - Integrate the chatbot with the database and LLM to interpret queries in context.
  - Ensure responses are generated using the client's specific data.
- **Expected Output:**  
  A working chatbot that provides accurate, context-aware legal data responses.

### 5. Error Handling & Continuous Improvement
- **Description:**  
  Implement mechanisms to minimize errors and continuously improve the system.
- **Actions:**  
  - Log errors and track performance metrics.
  - Provide a feedback loop for clients to report inaccuracies.
  - Schedule periodic retraining or updates for the LLM based on feedback.
- **Expected Output:**  
  A robust system that learns from errors and reduces manual intervention over time.

## Configuration Parameters
- **CLIENT_FOLDER_PATH:** Path to the root directory containing client folders.
- **TEMPLATE_FILE_PATTERN:** File naming or pattern rules for locating labelled templates.
- **LLM_MODEL:** Identifier or path for the open source LLM used for context extraction.
- **DATABASE_CONFIG:** Connection details and schema definitions for the target database.
- **CHATBOT_FRAMEWORK:** Integration details for the chatbot interface (API endpoints, libraries, etc.).

## Execution & Triggers
- **Automatic Trigger:**  
  - When a new client folder is added.
  - On a scheduled run (e.g., nightly batch processing).
- **Manual Trigger:**  
  - Via a dedicated command or button in the IDE.
- **Logging & Monitoring:**  
  - Log every processing step with timestamps.
  - Monitor system performance and error logs for debugging.

## Testing & Validation
- **Unit Tests:**  
  - Validate file scanning and text extraction.
  - Test LLM output for context accuracy.
  - Verify database insertion and query responses.
- **Integration Tests:**  
  - Ensure end-to-end processing from file ingestion to chatbot response.
  - Simulate client queries to confirm context-specific answers.
